# Eyes-Movement-Exercise
This exercise allows the user to load a basic set of eyes on to their screen and then control the movement / direction the eyes look by moving their cursor around the screen

How to Run: Load the page and then simply move your cursor around your screen to control the eyes.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: Next new functionality will be added to allow for you to change the size and color of the eyes. Also, new functionality will also be added to allow you to click on one eye causing it to wink, or hold down the space bar causing both eyes to close and blink.
